# Emotion Go/No-Go task. 

This is code for an ERP task of a word Go/No Go task. The task is modeled after Fournier et al. (2020). Briefly, there are 3 word categories (lists): negative, neutral, and positive valenced words. There are 32 words per list for a total of 96 words. 

Each word list is presented 6 times for a total of 18 blocks of the task. Word valence is not intermixed in a given block. There are 9 No-Go and 23 Go trials per block, and each word is presented for 1.5 seconds with a .75 to 1.25 second inter-trial interval (increments of .125 seconds). Participants are instructred to make a response to Go trials based on a particular font feature (i.e., normal font) and to withhold responses to No-Go trials based on another font feature (i.e., _italicized_ font). This mapping occured for 3 blocks of each word category, and for the other three blocks the contingencies were switched (i.e., Go trials were _italicized_ words and No-go trials were normal font). This was done to control for perceptual differences between Go and No-Go trials within participants. Responses should be made with the participants dominant hand. 

This task is programmed in PsychoPy Builder.
